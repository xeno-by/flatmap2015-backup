### macro demo

Hosts demos prepared for a flatMap workshop (27 Apr 2015).

The design of the next-generation macro system showcased in this demo
is a joint work of Eugene Burmako and Denys Shabalin. Thank you, Denys - it is a great pleasure to work with you!

One of the key enablers of the demo has arrived thanks to the work of Vojin Jovanovic who picked up Mikhail Mutcianko's interpreter for scala.reflect and adapted it to scala.meta. Great job, guys!
